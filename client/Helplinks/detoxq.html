        Most detox facilities in the state of New York will not admit patients without them having used their substance of 
        choice within the last three days and stating symptoms of withdrawal. The intake questions at the detox facility 
        must be answered accordingly. This whole process is flawed because it inhibits those who need rehab in order to 
        stay sober and those who are struggling after coming off outside of the three day window. Finally seeking help and 
        being denied can be a huge trigger in or itself, and that is why this website is here to help you get help and be 
        aware of how you will need to answer detox intake questions to be admitted.
        And, NO MATTER WHAT happens, don't get discouraged. Your path to a better life is ahead, and if feeling hopeless or 
        desperate in your search to heal, call 988 for mental health services. 
        You are cosmically valued and loved. </p>
