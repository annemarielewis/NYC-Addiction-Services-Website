      Finding the right rehab facility is one of the hardest steps in the process, especially if on
      medicaid insurance. This website was designed to help medicaid patients easily find and recieve 
      addiction treatment.</p>
  <p class="p">
      It is important to understand that most rehab facilities will require patients to first attend a detox 
      center before being admitted to rehab. This is required by most facilities so that substances can leave the patient's system
      in a monitored and medically adept environment. Most rehabs will require you to be admitted to a detox facility first,
      even if you're not going through active withdrawl. (NOTE: The rehab shouldn't force you to go to detox, but in order to 
      recieve rehab treatment, you must first admit yourself to detox). 
      Thus, it is important to understand how to get admitted to a detox facility so that you can then go to rehab. </p>
  <p class="p">
      Most detox facilities in the state of New York will not admit patients without them having used their substance of 
      choice within the last three days and stating symptoms of withdrawal. The intake questions at the detox facility 
      must be answered accordingly. This whole process is flawed because it inhibits those who need rehab in order to 
      stay sober and those who are struggling after coming off outside of the three day window. Finally seeking help and 
      being denied can be a huge trigger in or itself, and that is why this website is here to help you get help and be 
      aware of how you will need to answer detox intake questions to be admitted.
      And, NO MATTER WHAT happens, don't get discouraged. Your path to a better life is ahead, and if feeling hopeless or 
      desperate in your search to heal, call 988 for mental health services. 
      You are cosmically valued and loved. </p>
