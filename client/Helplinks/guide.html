    <p>If you are reading this, you are either seaking help for yourself or a loved one.
    Finding detox and rehab facilities is one of the hardest steps in the process, and this website was designed to help
    medicaid patients find and recieve help.
    It is important to understand that most rehab facilities will require patients to first attend a detox center before
    being admitted to rehab. This is required by most facilities so that substances can leave the patient's system
    in a monitored and medically adept environment. Most rehabs, even if you tell them you haven't been on your substance 
    of choice for weeks will still require you to be first admitted to a detox facility. They will not force you to be admitted
    to one, but in order to recieve rehab treatment, you first must admit yourself to detox. Thus, it is important to understand 
    how to be admitted to a detox facility.  Most detox facilities in the state of New York will not admit patients without them having used their substance of 
    choice within the last three and who state they have symptoms of withdrawal. If the intake questions at the detox facility 
    are not answered in this fashion, the patient will be refused admittance and likely not be able to go to rehab. This is a 
    VERY flawed design. It inhibits those who needs rehab in order to not relapse, or who are striggling after coming off outside 
    of the three day window, to not get help. IF THIS HAPPEN TO YOU, do not use again. Simply, go to another detox center, 
    or leave the center and come back in an hour and say you just used. They should then admit you. NO MATTER WHAT happens
    don't get discouraged. Finally seeking help and being denied can be a huge trigger in or itself, and that is why this
    website is here to help you get help. Be aware of how you need to answer detox intake questions in order to be admitted.
    Your path to a better life is ahead, and if feeling hopeless or desperate in your search to heal, call 988 for mental
    health services. You are cosmically valued and loved.
    See our Detox Intake Questions page to learn about how these questions must 
    be answered for admittance.</p>
