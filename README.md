POINT OF NODE:
To run js files in our terminal.
Our terminal reads information stored in our computer.
Node reads information stored in servers.
The server used in this project is a local server located within ...

POINT OF NODEMON:
So that we don't need to reload our server every tie we make a change, we use nodemon. Nodemon is
like node except it has this cool feature!

So why do we need to install Node if we install and use Nodemon?
--node can be used for everything nodemon is used for express to run a live server

POINT OF EXPRESS:
express connects our database to the server so that we can use the internet to display our data

POINT OF AXIOS:
Axios connects our backend db to the front end so that it can be styled and so that the controllers can be initiated
//when a button is clicked, etc

POINT OF MORGAN:
morgan will log the requests that we make to the server

POINT OF PARSER:
